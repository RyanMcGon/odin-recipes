    <ul>
        <li>3 (5.3 ounce) containers Greek yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon granulated garlic</li>
        <li>2 pounds chicken breasts</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>Quinoa:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Bowl:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>3 small cucumbers, quartered and chopped</li>
        <li>2 roasted red peppers, drained and sliced</li>
        <li>1 pint grape tomatoes, halved</li> 
        <li>1 ¼ cups Kalamata olives, sliced</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix Greek yogurt, oregano, lemon juice, black pepper, and granulated garlic
            together in a large bowl. Add chicken and coat with yogurt mixture. Cover and refrigerate; 
            let marinate 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Combine chicken broth, quinoa, and garlic in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to 
                low. Simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 20 minutes</li>
        <li>Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.
             Place peppers with cut sides down onto the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Cook under the preheated broiler until the skin of the peppers has blackened and blistered, 5 to 8 minutes.
             Let peppers cool for a few minutes before slicing and placing in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Place tomatoes, chickpeas, olives, and onion each into a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Combine olive oil, vinegar, feta cheese, lemon juice, black pepper, oregano, dill,
             and granulated garlic in a bowl. Whisk dressing, making sure to break up feta cheese</li>
        <li>Grill chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 8 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should
             read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from heat and let rest about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble 6 bowls by spooning quinoa into the bottom. Add cucumbers, roasted peppers,
             tomatoes, olives, chickpeas, and red onions around the perimeter of the bowl. Add chicken.</li>
        <li>Whisk dressing really well and spoon equally over bowls.</li>

    </ol>
